B2000, Homework 2
You should choose what hypothesis to test and how many observations to use. Tell me a bit about your experimental setup, your hypothesis, your recorded data, and what you can conclude from this little experiment. 

3) Hypothesis:
Based on our hypothesis we inputted 10 songs of Drake, and the other artists had 2 songs each to make it a total of 30 songs. We assumed that Drake appears the most, but the amount of times Drake will appear will be less than half.

Artist / # Of Times Artist was played.
Drake / IIIIIIIII (9)
Burna Boy/ I (1)
Lil Baby/ IIIII (5)
Jay Sean / III (3)
Shenseea / /II (2)
Rema / IIIII (5)
Lil Tjay / IIII (4)
Eminem / I (1)
Nicki Minaj / IIIII (5)
Cardi B / II (2)
Central Cee/ III (3)



Conclusion: 
As we conclude our experiment, our hypothesis was proven to be correct. We shuffled the playlist 40 times to observe the amount of times we would get a certain artist, and receiving Drake 9/40 justified our inquiry. Both parts of our hypothesis turned out to be  correct, as Drake appeared to be most frequent and him appearing less than 20 shuffles. The results prove that having an album of one artist in a single playlist which consists of multiple artists doesnâ€™t have a strong enough correlation to conclude that there is a fixed algorithm when it is shuffled.
